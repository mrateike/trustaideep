    datetime: "August 7th, 9:00 am to 12:00 pm",
    location: "Deep Learning Indaba 2026",

    about:
    "A growing practice in machine learning research is the use of large language models (LLMs) as automated evaluators, commonly referred to as LLM-as-judges. These models are used to assess outputs in place of established evaluation frameworks or human annotators or, primarily due to their convenience and cost efficiency. As this practice becomes increasingly normalized, it raises two fundamental concerns. First, how reliable, and thus trustworthy, are LLM-as-judges in research methodology? This concerns are particularly relevant in the African context, where limited resources may encourage greater reliance on LLM-as-judges. Second, how do the cultural values embedded in these models shape their evaluative decisions? Because most state- of- the - art LLMs are trained and aligned primarily on Western data and values, their use in evaluating Africa- related topics raises concerns about potential evaluation bias. Third, what are the broader implications of the increasing use of LLM-as-judges for the African continent? Replacing human annotators with LLM-as-judges risks centralizing evaluative authority in systems not grounded in African cultural contexts, while also undermining a key source of income for many African workers despite known concerns about their working conditions. This full- day workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders to discuss the trustworthiness of LLM-as-judges, with a particular focus on their role in research methodology and questions of cultural alignment, along with their broader socio-economic impacts in Africa. By creating space for this discussion, the workshop seeks to strengthen African-centered trustworthy AI ecosystems through evaluation practices that are inclusive, accountable, and reflective of diverse ways of knowing.",

This idea includes a cooperative AI development kit and an extension ecosystem to spark bottom-up innovation. Bringing together ideas from agritech to octopus conservation in Madagascar to jewelry making in Nairobi, I explore how cooperative AI can combat coloniality in AI alignment, avoid the “farmer’s market trap,” and chart a more just, inclusive AI future by and for the people it aims to uplift.",

This idea includes a cooperative AI development kit and an extension ecosystem to spark bottom-up innovation. Bringing together ideas from agritech to octopus conservation in Madagascar to jewelry making in Nairobi, I explore how cooperative AI can combat coloniality in AI alignment, avoid the “farmer’s market trap,” and chart a more just, inclusive AI future by and for the people it aims to uplift.",

        abstract:
          "As AI becomes an integral part of global technological advancement, the demand for systems that are trustworthy, transparent and inclusive is more urgent than ever. In the African context, characterised by diverse cultural norms, dynamic socio-economic landscapes and uneven digital infrastructure, the path to trustworthy AI requires locally grounded approaches that reflect the continent’s unique realities. This talk will explore how African perspectives can enrich global conversations on AI ethics by putting at the centre, values such as community, equity and contextual relevance. It will highlight the pivotal role of public awareness, civic education and inclusive stakeholder engagement in fostering trust in AI systems. Across the continent, promising initiatives are emerging that illustrate how what trustworthy AI could look like, from for example national AI strategies and policies, either in development or already adopted, to regional frameworks like the ‘African Union’s AI Continental Strategy’ or ‘The Africa Declaration on Artificial Intelligence’. These efforts signal that the continent is charting a path towards trustworthy AI by considering sustainable, inclusive and ethical AI for the continent. This talk will draw on these and other examples to demonstrate how public engagement is not just a communication exercise but a democratic imperative. It will argue that meaningful public participation serves as a safeguard against misuse, amplifies marginalised voices, and ensures that AI technologies are aligned with African priorities and public interests. Ultimately, trustworthy AI in Africa must be co-created with the people it aims to serve, grounded in context, guided by ethic and empowered by inclusive dialogue.",

Working in small groups, attendees will engage with one of two key themes: (1) Decoloniality of AI – examining how AI systems can reinforce global power imbalances, perpetuate problematic extraction of raw minerals, and embed Western-centric values. (2) Public Awareness of AI Ethics – addressing the challenges of bias, privacy, accountability, and the role of AI in shaping public trust and misinformation. Guided by the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) Prompt and Practice Cards, you'll engage in a structured ideation process using the AREA+ framework: Anticipate potential impacts, Reflect on ethical responsibilities, Engage with diverse perspectives, and Act to design responsible responses. Each group will identify key challenges, explore practical consequences, and collaboratively create innovative strategies or conceptual solutions. This session fosters active collaboration, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving, equipping you with a practical framework for addressing AI ethics in real-world contexts.",

        abstract:
          "Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare have accelerated exponentially. While AI has the potential to improve healthcare for the better, like other advancements in medical technology, it also has the potential to increase health disparities. Historically, medical technology has not been created with the needs of underserved settings in mind and this has led to limited access in low/middle income countries. Reduced access to these healthcare tools leads to downstream gaps in data used to train machine learning models, and by extension, the potential for machine learning biases, should these models be used on individuals from historically excluded settings. In this talk I will provide an overview of our work on a health equity toolbox for evaluating large language models for surfacing model harms and bias, the development of the AfriMed-QA and TRINDS -  African-focussed health datasets for LLM evaluation and tuning, and the Nteasee Study, a mixed methods study to understand general population and expert perspectives on AI for health in Africa, including a deep dive on algorithmic fairness and colonialism. I will end with brief examples of considerations for beneficial applications of AI for health equity. Overall, I hope to make a case for considering geo-contextual perspectives for the ecosystem of AI development and evaluation for health.",

    about:
      "Recent years have seen an overwhelming body of work on fairness and robustness in machine learning (ML) models. This is not unexpected, as it is an increasingly important concern as ML models are used to support decision-making in high-stakes applications such as mortgage lending, hiring, and diagnosis in healthcare. Trustworthy AI aims to provide an explainable, robust, and fair decision-making process. In addition, transparency and security also play a significant role in improving the adoption and impact of ML solutions. Currently, most ML models assume ideal conditions and rely on the assumption that test/clinical data comes from the same distribution of the training samples. However, this assumption is not satisfied in most real-world applications; in a clinical setting, we can find different hardware devices, diverse patient populations, or samples from unknown medical conditions. On the other hand, we need to assess potential disparities in outcomes that can be translated and deepened in our ML solutions. Particularly, data and models are often imported from external sources in addressing solutions in developing countries, thereby risking potential security issues. The divergence of data and model from a population at hand also poses a lack of transparency and explainability in the decision-making process. In this second edition of the workshop, we aim to bring researchers, policymakers, and regulators to discuss ways to ensure security and transparency while addressing fundamental problems in developing countries, particularly, when data and models are imported and/or collected locally with less focus on ethical considerations and governance guidelines.",

Particularly, data and models often imported from external sources in addressing solutions in developing countries, thereby  risking potential security issues.   The  divergence of data and model from population at hand also poses a lack of transparency and explainabilty of the decision making process. Thus,  a  workshop at Deep Indaba 2022 on this specific theme aims to bring researchers, policy makers and regulators to discuss on ways to ensure security and transparency while addressing fundamental problems in developing countries, particularly, when data and models are imported and/or collected locally with less focus on ethical consideraions and governance guidelines.",

        abstract:
          "As researchers and technology companies rush to develop artificial intelligence (AI) applications that aid the health of marginalized communities, it is critical to consider the needs of the community health workers (CHWs) who will be increasingly expected to operate tools that incorporate these technologies. My previous work has shown that these users have low levels of AI knowledge, form incorrect mental models about how AI works, and at times, may trust algorithmic decisions more than their own. This is concerning, given that AI applications targeting the work of CHWs are already in active development and early deployments in low-resource healthcare settings have already reported failures that created additional workflow inefficiencies and inconvenienced patients. Explainable AI (XAI) can help avoid such pitfalls, but nearly all prior work has focused on users that live in relatively resource-rich settings (e.g., the US and Europe) and that arguably have substantially more experience with digital technologies such as AI. My research works to develop XAI for people with low levels of formal education and technical literacy, with a focus on healthcare in low-resource domains. This work involves demoing interactive prototypes with CHWs to understand what aspects of model decision-making need to be explained and how they can be explained most effectively, with the goal of improving how current XAI methods serve novice technology users.",
